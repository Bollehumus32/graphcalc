What is GraphCalc?
------------------
GraphCalc is intended as a replacement for TI graphing calculators.
Right now we are aiming to replicate most of the TI-84 Plus.

How do I use it?
----------------
There are a couple of ways to use Graph Calc:

1. Run GraphCalc.py through Python 3 with matplotlib installed
2. Run a frozen version, availiable through the Github homepage_.
